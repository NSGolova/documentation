## What is Reactive UI?

Reactive is a declarative, reactive UI library tailored for performance and composability.
It empowers developers to build dynamic, data-driven interfaces by binding the UI directly to the application state.
Instead of manually updating the UI, changes to data automatically propagate to the view.

With Reactive UI, you can:
- Define views as functions of state.
- Automatically update the UI when the state changes.
- Compose components in a modular and predictable way.

This approach reduces boilerplate, avoids bugs caused by inconsistent UI state, and scales well for complex applications.

## Why do we need a new solution?

Currently, **BSML (Beat Saber Markup Language)** is the only and most popular solution for creating UI in Beat Saber mods.
While it has served the modding community well, it's beginning to show its limitations ‚Äî especially as the complexity of modern UIs increases.

### üìÑ XML-Based = Rigid and Verbose

BSML uses **XML for markup**, which comes with several drawbacks:

- Very limited logic capabilities (no conditions, loops, or reactive binding)
- UI is often spread across multiple files, making the codebase harder to follow
- Component composition is clunky and error-prone

You're often forced to resort to code-behind to make anything dynamic ‚Äî defeating the purpose of a declarative UI.

### üé≠ Missing Modern UI Essentials

BSML lacks many **quality-of-life features** expected in modern UIs:

- No built-in animation system
- No reactive state bindings
- Poor layout flexibility (especially for dynamic UIs)

The result is often a static, lifeless interface with hardcoded behavior, and layout hacks.

## Why choose Reactive over BSML?

**ReactiveUI** offers several key advantages for developers who prefer a more code-driven and reactive approach:

### üîÑ Fully Reactive by Design

ReactiveUI is built around **reactive state management**.
When your data changes, the UI updates automatically ‚Äî no need for manual refreshes or event wiring.

### üß† Logic-First, Not Markup-First

ReactiveUI keeps your UI logic in **C# code**, right where your state and business logic live.
This results in better cohesion, easier debugging, and simpler testing ‚Äî without juggling XML or markup files.

### üß± Composable and Modular

Components are just C# objects. You can **compose them like functions**, nest them conditionally, or dynamically generate them based on app state.
This makes layouts more **flexible and expressive** than static markup.

### üìê Modern Layout Engine (Yoga)

ReactiveUI uses **Meta‚Äôs Yoga layout engine**,
the same system used by React Native and other high-performance UI frameworks.
This gives you access to:

- Flexbox-based layout
- Advanced UI adaptivity
- Dynamic sizing and alignment

All configured via familiar C# APIs instead of markup attributes.

### üß∞ Better IDE Support

Since ReactiveUI is fully written in C#, you benefit from:

- IntelliSense
- Type checking
- Code navigation
- Refactoring tools

There‚Äôs **no context switching** between your UI and logic ‚Äî it‚Äôs all in one place.

### üöÄ Performance-Oriented

ReactiveUI tracks **fine-grained dependencies** and re-renders only what‚Äôs necessary.
This ensures high performance, even for rapidly updating or state-heavy components.

# Few samples

So, let's omit redundant discussions and move to the samples to visually show how easy is it to make complicated components.

### Counter

```csharp
class Counter : ReactiveComponent {
    private ObservableValue<int> _value;

    protected override GameObject Construct() {
        // Calling Remember requires specifying a default value
        _value = Remember(0);

        return new Label()
            .Animate(_value, (x, y) => x.Text = $"Value: {y}")
            .Use();
    }

    public void Tick() {
        _value.Value++;
    }
}
```
This example shows how to create a simple text counter that will increment with each `Tick` call.
It uses `Remember` method to create an observable state that can be used to bind components.
Pretty easy and straightforward, isn't it?
Let's add a button to complicate it a bit:

```csharp
class ButtonCounter : ReactiveComponent {
    protected override GameObject Construct() {
        var value = Remember(0);

        return new Clickable {
            OnClick = () => {
                value.Value++;
            },

            Children = {
                new Label()
                    .Animate(value, (x, y) => x.Text = $"Value: {y}")
                    .WithRectExpand()
            }
        }.Use();
    }
}
```
Now the value updates each time the button is pressed
(the label acts like a button here as `Clickable` is a contentless wrapper),
so the label text is also changes following the observable.

### Animated button

```csharp
class ButtonCounter : ReactiveComponent {
    protected override GameObject Construct() {
        var value = RememberAnimated(1f, 200.ms());

        return new ImageButton()
            .WithListener(x => x.IsHovered, x => value.Value = x ? 1.2f : 1f)
            .Animate(value, (x, y) => x.ContentTransform.localScale = y * Vector3.one)
            .Use();
    }
}
```
This example shows how to scale a button based on if it's hovered or not.
As you can see, alongside with `Remember`, there is a `RememberAnimated` method.
Unlike its neighbor, it creates an animated observable value
that interpolates between the latest that and the target one.
Furthermore, the component involves using `WithListener` method which is a shortcut for subscribing to `NotifyPropertyChanged`.

## Layout

We've talked about some simple cases where advanced layout is not needed.
But imagine a situation when your layout to be reusable and adaptive: it would be almost impossible with pure unity.
So here comes Yoga, a web-like layout engine which is tightly integrated with the library.

### Reimagined ButtonCounter

Let's return to one of the previous examples and take as a base for the next one:
```csharp
class ButtonCounter : ReactiveComponent {
    protected override GameObject Construct() {
        var value = Remember(0);

        return new Clickable {
                OnClick = () => {
                    value.Value++;
                },

                Children = {
                    new Label()
                        .Animate(value, (x, y) => x.Text = $"Value: {y}")
                        .AsFlexItem()
                }
            }
            .AsFlexItem(maxSize: new() { x = 50f })
            .AsFlexGroup(padding: new() { top = 1f })
            .Use();
    }
}
```
So what exactly happens here? We've removed the `WithRectExpand` method that was expanding the label to fit the parent,
and added not only `AsFlexItem`, but `AsFlexGroup` as well. TLDR; Layout in ReactiveUI involves three types of nodes:
- Node
- Controller
- Leaf Node (we'll talk about it later)

Basically, any Node instance is controlled by the parent's Controller.
If there is no controller on the parent component, the node will be outside the layout flow.
Speaking easily: `AsFlexItem` without an `AsFlexGroup` does nothing unless called on a root node.

Let's return to the example. So, once again, what is happening there?
The `AsFlexItem` call on the label makes it enter the layout flow, without any additional conditions (no call args).
The same call on the clickable container makes it a layout node with a maxSize condition, so the container won't be able to grow up more than 50pt.
But it's not a controller node yet, that's why we call `AsFlexGroup` which assigns a controller to the node making it start controlling its' children.

The whole system sounds a bit complicated, but trust me, it's not that difficult once you dive into it.
